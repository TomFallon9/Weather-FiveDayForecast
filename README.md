## Description



I built a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) Once a city has been entered it will save as an option for the future as well as display the 5 day forecast.
